//Objective
//Today, we're learning about Key-Value pair mappings using a Map or Dictionary data structure.
//Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials and an instructional video!

//Task
//Given n names and phone numbers, assemble a phone book that maps friends' names to their respective phone numbers.
//You will then be given an unknown number of names to query your phone book for. For each name queried,
//print the associated entry from your phone book on a new line in the form name=phoneNumber;
//if an entry for name is not found, print Not found instead.

//Note: Your phone book should be a Dictionary/Map/HashMap data structure.



//Input Format

//The first line contains an integer, n, denoting the number of entries in the phone book.
//Each of the n subsequent lines describes an entry in the form of 2 space-separated values on a single line.
//The first value is a friend's name, and the second value is an 8-digit phone number.

//After the n lines of phone book entries, there are an unknown number of lines of queries.
//Each line (query) contains a name to look up, and you must continue reading lines until there is no more input.

//Note: Names consist of lowercase English alphabetic letters and are first names only.

//Sample Input

//3
//sam 99912222
//tom 11122222
//harry 12299933
//sam
//edward
//harry
//Sample Output

//sam=99912222
//Not found
//harry=12299933
