//Task

//A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backwards and forwards.
//Can you determine if a given string, s, is a palindrome?

//To solve this challenge, we must first take each character in s, enqueue it in a queue, and also push that same
//character onto a stack. Once that's done, we must dequeue the first character from the queue and pop the top
//character off the stack, then compare the two characters to see if they are the same; as long as the characters
//match, we continue dequeueing, popping, and comparing each character until
//our containers are empty (a non-match means s isn't a palindrome).

//Write the following declarations and implementations:

//Two instance variables: one for your stack, and one for your queue.
//A void pushCharacter(char ch) method that pushes a character onto a stack.
//A void enqueueCharacter(char ch) method that enqueues a character in the queue instance variable.
//A char popCharacter() method that pops and returns the character at the top of the stack instance variable.
//A char dequeueCharacter() method that dequeues and returns the first character in the queue instance variable.
