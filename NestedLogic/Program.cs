//Task
//Your local library needs your help! Given the expected and actual return dates for a library book, create a program that calculates the fine (if any). The fee structure is as follows:

//1.If the book is returned on or before the expected return date, no fine will be charged (i.e.:fine = 0 .
//2.If the book is returned after the expected return day but still within the same calendar month and year as the expected return date,fine = 15 Hackos * (number Of days late) .
//3.If the book is returned after the expected return month but still within the same calendar year as the expected return date, the fine = 500 Hackos * (number of months late).
//4.If the book is returned after the calendar year in which it was expected, there is a fixed fine of 1000 Hackos.
